# Two-Player Games, Alpha-Beta and Dynamic Programming
The goal of this project is to formalize two-player games and algorithms for finding best moves, such as the classical alpha-beta algorithm1 , and to instantiate the formalization on a particular variant of the game of Nim, called the game of “Min”.
